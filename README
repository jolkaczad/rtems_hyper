Perhaps later, this file will be the starting point for a list of documents
describing the project in detail. Right now it will only contain a list of
matters which might be relevant for the code review.

ISSUES

# The linking process is perhaps just a couple lines away from being fixed.
RTEMS alone compiles fine, since it just builds libraries which it's normal
to have unresolved symbols. The problem appears when building the application,
it has to link against libpok to be able to make syscalls and the place for linker
customization is inside bsp_specs. I spent more time than I'd like to admit on
trying to get this work but failed miserably, hence the 'collect_script.sh'
script as a temporary solution.

# A ENABLE_HYPERVISOR parameter is passed to the configuration script to alter
the way certain headers from cpukit/score/cpu/i386 are handled via a global
'#define __RTEMS_ENABLE_HYPERVISOR__'. A strange bug appeared at one point, 
causing the parameter to be invisible in certain *.h files, so that is why 
at the moment the definition of __RTEMS_ENABLE_HYPERVISOR__ is hardcoded 
inside headers from cpukit/../i386.

These will be elaborated on when proper documentation and buglist is created.
