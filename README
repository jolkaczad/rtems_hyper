INTRODUCTION

The ultimate goal of this project is to have a generic adaptation layer in the
form of a BSP to be used on hypevisor operating systems like POK, XantruM or
Xen, though up until now only some work on supporting POK was done. Eventually,
a hypervisor will be able to run one or many instances of RTEMS seemingly at
once, allowing them to communicate with the hardware and with each other. 

A more detailed descrpition is provided in the following files from the root
directory:
