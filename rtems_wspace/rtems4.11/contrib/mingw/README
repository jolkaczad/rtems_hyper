To build mingw32 tools on a Fedora Core 7 box:

1. Add makensis to your path.

   $ export PATH=/opt/nsis/2.29/bin:$PATH

2. Set up the RPM packages:

   $ cat ~/.rpmrc
   os_canon: mingw32: mingw32 23
   arch_canon: mingw32: i686 1
   arch_compat: mingw32: i686 noarch
   buildarch_compat: mingw32: i686 noarch
   optflags: mingw32 -O2 -g
   optflags: i686 -O2 -pipe
   $ cat ~/.rpmmacros
   %_topdir /home2/work/chris/rtems/4.8/packages
   %_tmppath /home2/work/chris/tmp/rtems
   %_rpmdir        %_topdir/%_target_os/RPMS
   %_srcrpmdir     %_topdir/%_target_os/SRPMS
   %_signature gpg
   # %_gpg_path ~/.gnupg
   # %_gpg_name "RTEMS Packager"
   %_gpg_name rtems
   %vendor: RTEMS Project
   %packager chrisj@rtems.org
   %distribution RTEMS Project http://www.rtems.org/
   $ mkdir -p /home2/work/chris/rtems/4.8/packages
   $ mkdir /home2/work/chris/rtems/4.8/packages/SOURCES
   $ mkdir /home2/work/chris/rtems/4.8/packages/BUILD
   $ mkdir -p /home2/work/chris/rtems/4.8/packages/linux/SRPMS
   $ mkdir -p /home2/work/chris/rtems/4.8/packages/linux/RPMS
   $ mkdir -p /home2/work/chris/rtems/4.8/packages/mingw32/SRPMS
   $ mkdir -p /home2/work/chris/rtems/4.8/packages/mingw32/RPMS
   $ cp /home2/work/chris/rtems/4.8/head/contrib/crossrpms/patches/* \
        /home2/work/chris/rtems/4.8/packages/SOURCES/.

   Download the required sources to:

     /home2/work/chris/rtems/4.8/packages/SOURCES

   The list you need depends on what version you build. A tool exists
   that atempts to determine the package. Ask on the list for it.

2. Run the build.sh script where:

    -d            : debug output from the script and nested scripts
    -h host       : the host to buidl for
    -p prefix     : the prefix (not that important for mingw)
    -s crossrpms  : the path to the crossrpms source tree
    -r relocation : the path for the NSIS installer executables

   $ export PATH=/opt/rtems-4.8/bin:$PATH
   $ cd /home2/work/chris/rtems/4.8/head/contrib/crossrpms
   $ ./bootstrap
   $ cd /home2/work/chris/rtems/4.8/head/contrib/mingw
   $ ./build.sh -d -h mingw32 \
         -p /home2/work/chris/rtems/4.8/build/rpms \
         -s /home2/work/chris/rtems/4.8/head/contrib/crossrpms \
         -r /home2/work/chris/rtems/4.8/build/mingw

   Sit back and wait. The build take a long time on a fast machine.
